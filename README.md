# Community-Crypto-Union

Community-Crypto-Union and Exchange founds itself on the principles of Sovereignty, Independence and Privacy.

I, as leader of project development of the; Community-Crypto-Union and Exchange Project am asking everyone and anyone to team up with me on this monumental project.  I am asking like minded individuals to participate in this crypto-currency development project.  I will create an alternative solution to the existing and dying USD based financial system.  I feel that International demand for crypto account services will increase substantially over the next few years.  The <a href="https://www.crypto-news.net/beyond-cryptocurrency-blockchain-use-growing-rapidly-outside-of-finance-industry/" target="_blank">adoption and use of crypto-currencies is increasing</a> and I get to provide crypto financial account services to everyone on this planet that is interested. 

At this point in time, <a href="http://www.heatledger.com/" target="_blank">HEATLedger</a> blochchain solutions appear to be the best platform to implement and developed a first generation crypto-union and exchange concept.  My first concept of crypto-union and exchange includes union of account holders in common cause with stated community-crypto-union priciples as stated, sovereignty, independence and privacy.  The crypto-union concept supports union members to collaborate and vote and work together in developing the future of community-crypto-union.  I am looking at the OpenLedger DC as an ongoing model of what community-crypto-union can be.  I am always open to new possibilities to bring forth my vision; community-crypto-union

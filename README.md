# Community-Crypto-Union Asset Exchange-  CCUAE

Community-Crypto-Union Asset Exchange founds itself on the principles of Sovereignty, Independence and Privacy.

I, as leader of project development of a:  Community-Crypto-Union Asset Exchange Project am inviting everyone to team up with me on this monumental project.  This project is not about me, it's all about bringing forth an alternative in the crypto-space where there was none.  I am asking like minded individuals to participate, contribute and collaborate with me together in creating a community-crypto-unionin asset exchange for everyone.  I will create an alternative solution to the existing and dying fiat based financial system.  I feel that International demand for crypto account services will increase substantially over the next few years.  The <a href="https://www.crypto-news.net/beyond-cryptocurrency-blockchain-use-growing-rapidly-outside-of-finance-industry/" target="_blank">adoption and use of crypto-currencies is increasing</a> and I/we get to provide crypto financial account services to everyone on this planet that is interested. 

At this point in time, <a href="http://www.heatledger.com/" target="_blank">HEATLedger</a> blochchain solutions appear to be the best platform to implement and developed the next generation of crypto-union and asset exchange.  My first concept of crypto-union and asset exchange includes union of account holders in common cause with stated community-crypto-union priciples as stated, sovereignty, independence and privacy.  The crypto-union concept supports union members to collaborate, work together  and vote to create the future of Community-Crypto-Union Asset Exchange.  I am looking at the OpenLedger DC as a staring point for Community-Crypto-Union Asset Exchange.  Will you consider participating in the future of blockchain based personal financial solutions...
